**Hi. I am Karen Schwane.** A software developer living in Oslo, Norway.

My current role is Android developer at [FINN.no](https://finn.no/), Norway's largest marketplace.

I have been developing for Android in some way or another for five years now. <br/>
Four of these were spent at [TheAppGuys](https://theappguys.de){:target="_blank"}, a mobile agency based in Cologne, Germany.

Before, I was involved in various research projects in the Digital Humanitites field, in backend as well as frontend roles and everything in between.

I have a Master's degree in [Media Culture Studies](http://www.mekuwi.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/){:target="_blank"} and [Media Computer Science](http://hki.uni-koeln.de/){:target="_blank"} from the University of Cologne.


My current tech obsession: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/){:target="_blank"}! ðŸ’œ
