**Hi. I am Karen Schwane.** A software developer in Oslo, Norway.

I'm originally from Germany and moved to Norway in 2019.

My current role is Android developer at [FINN.no](https://finn.no/), Norway's largest marketplace.

I have been developing for Android since 2014 but I've also done bits of backend and frontend work here and there. 👩🏼‍💻<br/>

My current tech obsession: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/){:target="_blank"}! 💜
