**Hi. I am Karen Schwane.** A software developer based in Cologne, Germany.

In my job at the awesome mobile agency [TheAppGuys](https://theappguys.de){:target="_blank"} I am Lead Developer with a focus on all things Android.

Before, I was involved in various research projects in the Digital Humanitites field, in backend as well as frontend roles and everything in between.

I have a Master's degree in [Media Culture Studies](http://www.mekuwi.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/){:target="_blank"} and [Media Computer Science](http://hki.uni-koeln.de/){:target="_blank"} from the University of Cologne.

Whenever I can, I try to teach and mentor code newbies, for example in community projects like [Jugend hackt](https://jugendhackt.org/){:target="_blank"} or [Djangogirls](https://djangogirls.org/cologne/).

My current tech obsession: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/){:target="_blank"}! ðŸ’œ
